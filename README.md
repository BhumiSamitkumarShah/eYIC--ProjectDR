Project Title-

Diabetic Retinopathy is the ruling disease-causing sightlessness across all over the world.It’s caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the rear of the eye. This Diabetic Retinopathy should be detected accurately and at the right time otherwise; it takes to the visionless world.

Using the concept of Machine learning we can obtain rapidly result.Currently, detecting DR is a long and manual process that needs the trained clinician to identify the DR. therefore, we develop an automatic trained model that predicts accurately using Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and giving the strength to cure clinicians in real-time.

A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4, according to the following scale:

0 - No DR
1 - Mild
2 - Moderate
3 - Severe
4 - Proliferative DR
